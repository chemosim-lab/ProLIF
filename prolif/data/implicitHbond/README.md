The example `1s2g__1__1.A_2.C__1.D` is originally from PLINDER tutorial dataset.

Suggested by [our PDB tutorial](https://prolif.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/pdb.html#pdb):
The protonated protein was prepared with [PypKa](https://pypka.org/) and its default settings.
* `receptor_ph7_amber.pdb`
However, some atoms are too close to recognize bonds correctly. Need to fix manually.
* `receptor_ph7_amber2.pdb`

The protonated ligand was prepared by PyMOL3.
