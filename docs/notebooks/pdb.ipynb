    "This tutorial showcases how to use ProLIF to generate an interaction fingerprint for interactions between a protein and a ligand in a PDB file. There are several preparation steps which you need to follow before generating an interaction fingerprint with ProLIF.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{important}\n",
    "For convenience, the different files for this tutorial are included with the ProLIF installation, and we'll access these files through `plf.datafiles.datapath` which is a {class}`pathlib.Path` object pointing to the tutorials data directory. This makes it easier to manipulate paths to files, match filenames using wildcards...etc. in a Pythonic way, but you can also use plain strings, e.g. `\"/home/user/prolif/data/vina/rec.pdb\"` instead of `plf.datafiles.datapath / \"vina\" / \"rec.pdb\"` if you prefer.\n",

    "## Prerequisite\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to split your PDB file in two: one file for the protein and one file for the ligand.\n",
    "There are different ways to do that, from the command line with `grep`, or from a GUI such as PyMOL.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to generate a valid molecule (with bond orders and charges) from a PDB file and correctly detect HBond interactions, **ProLIF requires the protein file to contain explicit hydrogens.**\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Having only polar hydrogens explicit may work if you use RDKit for reading the file, although they are some caveats around protonable residues such as histidines which RDKit may not recognize correctly due to naming conventions, we therefore encourage users to have **all hydrogens explicit** in the file and use MDAnalysis instead.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to protonate residues in your protein file, there are several strategies available, via command-line tools that you can install locally, or webservers, here are a few suggestions:\n",
    "- [PypKa](https://pypka.org/) available through a [webserver](https://pypka.org/run-pypka/) or as a [CLI tool](https://pypka.readthedocs.io/),\n",
    "- [H++](http://newbiophysics.cs.vt.edu/H++/) webserver\n",
    "- [PDB2PQR](https://server.poissonboltzmann.org/) available through a [webserver](https://server.poissonboltzmann.org/pdb2pqr) or as a [CLI tool](https://pdb2pqr.readthedocs.io/). Make sure to then convert the output PQR file to a PDB file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this step is done, and you've verified that the prepared PDB file contains explicit hydrogens (and optionally explicit bonds), we can finally use that as input.\n",
    "We have 2 options to read the protein file: MDAnalysis (preferred) or RDKit (faster but risky, see below).\n",
